# Game-of-Life

This game of life was created for my cs142 class in 2015. The assignment was to practice building my Java programming skills as well as my ability to read and build upon other programmers code. LifeGUI file was built by my instructor as well as the state file. From there the files were passed off to me and I had to complete the game of life. 

To run the game, download all four java files and run the lifeGUI.java file.
